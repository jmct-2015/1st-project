    <h2>The Steam Machine project, initially launched and subsequently discontinued in the late 2010s, has been revived by Valve with a new console announced in November 2025. This second iteration is a dedicated living room gaming PC designed to provide a console-like experience for a user's entire Steam library. The original machines failed due to a lack of compatible native Linux games at the time, a problem the new version aims to solve with the mature Proton compatibility layer from the Steam Deck. </h2>
